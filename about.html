					Hi, my name is Anson and I am currently a second-year student at the Queen Mary University of London studying Computer Science. I started studying in the United Kingdom since I was thirteen years old. Being one of the boarders, I became independent and self-disciplined. This has benefited me by preparing me to be for self-reliant when at the university. My enthusiasm for computer science grew rapidly when I started my A-level ICT course. I realised that computer technology is an essential element that humans need to rely on to survive and develop the world we now live in. 
					<br/><br/>
					I considered myself as an outgoing person who likes to explode on new things. My friends often say I am responsible and really hard working because I try to make myself busy in focusing on academic works as well as going on badminton trainig regularly, so I gain a balance life. THerefore, I don’t like sitting around and being inactive because I feel like it is wasting my time and potential. I treasure my time, so I rather use my free time to hang out with friends, watching a documentary or focusing on academic work. This way, my life is more fulfilling and able to gain more experiences and skills and knowledge.
					<br/><br/>

					In academic wise, I just finished two group projects this year and both required to build applications using React connected it to firebase. The first project was building a prototype application for the company called FML, our team aimed to build a training online schedule for FML's training course for both trainers and schedulers. Whereas, the second project was to create a weather app with unique features that current existing weather apps don't have.  Our team created both projects as browser applications so that the system will be highly accessible to all end-users through several devices and browsing platforms. We have ensured that the user interface is not compromised when switching between mobile and desktop devices to allow a seamless transition for users switching between portable and non-portable devices.
					<br/><br/>
					I enjoy designing and developing websites to improve my web development skills. My first experience in web programming was last year where I learnt how to build a basic portfolio website for myself and I enjoyed it because I like designing and being creative. Even though I have limited experiences in web programming, I’m willing to practice and research by myself in extra work to gain better understanding and knowledge and skills on that so I can achieve a better website application.

					Besides the academic part, my hobbies are playing the piano, hanging out with friends and playing badminton. I have been participating in the New Year Winter Swimming Lifesaving Championship in Hong Kong since I was six years old, so for fourteen years, I have developed endurance and stamina. At the same time, I was the badminton club leader and coaching assistant at schools in both Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. This leadership role enables me to manage challenges and became an effective leader and communicator.<br/>

					<br/>Furthermore, I continued my passion by joining the badminton society since my 1st at the university. I am currently the treasurer and women’s team captain of badminton society. As a team captain, it builds up my leadership skills and become more responsible as I have to lead my team to go for matches and I have to coach and support them in every way. Similarly, as a treasurer, I need to work with other committee members all the time to organise matches for the club and facilities, so I know how to communicate with other people and student union to make sure the club runs smoothly. And I am responsible for the clubs’ finances, so I have to deal with the clubs’ expends and earning, used to budgeting so I believe I’m suitable for working in a bank. Moreover, being a balanced student, I had achieved Grade 5 piano with a distinction and Grade 6 music theory. I have been playing the piano since I was 6 years old and this has become one of my favourite hobbies for relaxation. 
					<br/><br/>
					To balance out my life with study, I love travelling as well because it's a way to experience something unfamiliar and leave with new skills or knowledge. My first alone trip was Malaysia where I gained the opportunity to discover their history, geography and sociology and I believe every destination has something unique to teach us. I think travelling benefit me in a way of getting to know myself. Getting away from home allows me to reflect on my life by having the needed time and space to let my mind wander. Most importantly, we might mire our daily life and it's easy to lose sight of what we have. Therefore, having explored another place will give us a fresh appreciation from our hometown and be thankful for how lucky we are to have a stable life. <br/>
